# uwu2x7.0 Source Code Disclosure

In response to the admission of copying my GPL 3.0-licensed code and utilizing GPL 3.0 libraries without proper attribution, my request for credit and code release was denied. As a result, I have proactively open-sourced the uwu2x7.0 code on the behalf of the 'original creator'

Primary Components:
- processor.py: Houses crucial code.

- writer.py: Contains logic for writing the input video.

These are all in the same fashion as the original codebase of The Anime Scripter: https://github.com/NevermindNilas/TheAnimeScripter, with the same functionality and structure.

# uwu2x7.0 Source Code Disclosure

In response to the admission of copying my GPL 3.0-licensed code and utilizing GPL 3.0 libraries without proper attribution, my request for credit and code release was denied. As a result, I have proactively open-sourced the uwu2x7.0 code.

Primary Components:
- processor.py: Houses crucial code.
- connector.py: Facilitates server connection and data transmission.
- reader.py: Contains logic for reading the input video.
- writer.py: Contains logic for writing the input video.

These are all in the same fashion as the original codebase, with the same functionality and structure.

## Data Privacy Concerns

User data, including IP addresses, PC specs, activity logs, and composition names, is being stored. The deobfuscated code in index.jsx reveals usage of a strong, likely tokenized, jsxbin compiler, concealing variables but leaving underlying code exposed.
